# nitro-vue-tailwindcss

A simple full-stack TypeScript Framework utilizing Nitro, Vite, Vue 3 and TailwindCSS. 

## I don't think you should use this

We have [Nuxt](nuxt.com), which does all of these, but _better_. However, if you find Nuxt to be overkill for what you need, then this might pique your interest.


This does not support:
- SSR
- SSG
